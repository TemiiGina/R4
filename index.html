    <h1>R3: Interface and Interpretation</h1>

    <p>In Lev Manovich's "Database as Symbolic Form," he explores the differences and similarities between the realms of database and narrative in modern media. Manovich describes databases as structures that offer non-linear, non-hierarchical access to information, as opposed to the linear, structured progression of traditional narratives. However, the lines between these forms get blurred regarding contemporary interactive narratives, which is apparent in computer games and beyond. Manovich uses this idea to prompt a reflection on the broader spectrum of interactive storytelling in our culture.</p>

    <p>Computer games highlight the fusion of structured narrative frameworks within a database of potential choices, seen in RPGs, create your own adventure games etc. Other forms of interactive narratives exist, such as immersive theater experiences, role-playing activities like improv acting, and interactive storytelling sessions allowing participants to actively influence and shape the narrative, showing the overlap of structured storytelling and user interaction beyond the digital gaming space.</p>
        
    <p>The evolution of technology has contributed significantly to the increase of interactive narratives, making Manovich’s predictions regarding the influence of databases on cultural forms more apparent in the real world. The integration of database structures into various media forms has become more pervasive, especially with the advent of social media and personalized content delivery systems, giving users more agency in their engagement with content. Some shows have taken this approach such as Black Mirror’s Bandersnatch episode, allowing viewers to interact with the narrative by selecting the characters' choices and determining the ending. However, the persistence of traditional narrative structures in conventional media remains evident, showing an ongoing conflict between structured storytelling and database-driven content creation. In certain spaces, there remains an appeal for structured storytelling in captivating audiences, for instance, book series with a fan following.</p>
        
    <p>For my final project, the idea of interactive narrative can be incorporated by creating customizable interfaces where user can decide how they interact with the website. This could be in the form of customizable layouts, colour schemes, shapes etc. that the user can play around with. This could also be arranging elements in a way that users are not prompted towards any particular course of action but are encouraged to explore the site freely.</p>
